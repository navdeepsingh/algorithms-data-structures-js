# Algorithms & Data Structures in JavaScript.

This repo is to track my learnings [from this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/) by [Stephen Grider](https://twitter.com/ste_grider) And Following repo from [https://github.com/IamManchanda/algorithms-javascript](https://github.com/IamManchanda/algorithms-javascript) by [Harman Manchanda] (https://twitter.com/harmanmanchanda)

## Questions and their respective Answers. And Tests.
- **Question:** All folders have specific `README.md` where respective question has been asked.
- **Answers:** All folders have specific `index.js` where respective answer has been solved.
- **Tests:** All folders have specific `test.js` which contains respective test file. Use Jest for same as mentioned below.

## Test with Jest

Step1:  Install Jest

```bash
npm install -g jest
```

Step2: Run Jest into the targeted test such as

```bash
jest 001-reversestring/test.js --watch
```
or
```bash
npm test 001-reversestring/test.js
```


## Debugger Steps
- Add a debugger statement in your function
- Call the function manually
- At the terminal, run `node inspect index.js`
- To continue execution of file, press `c` then `enter`
- To launch repl (Read Evaluate Print Loop) sessoion, type `repl` then `enter`
- To exit the repl, Press Ctrl + C
